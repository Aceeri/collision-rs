This is a collision detection library written in rust. The intent of this
library is to build upon the primitives found in cgmath-rs and flesh out the
library into a more concrete collision detection library.

# Building #

collision-rs can be built with [Cargo](http://crates.io). To use collision-rs
in your project, append the following specification to `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies.collision]
git = "https://github.com/csherratt/collision-rs"
```
